# TidyCGE
Back up of TidyCGE shinyapp

This shinyapp explores the csv results from [GEMPACK](https://www.copsmodels.com/gempack.htm) (General Equilibrium Modelling PACKage), which is is a suite of economic modelling software. It is especially suitable for computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, but can handle a wide range of economic behaviour.   

The app utilises [shiny modules](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html) to simplify the code and facilitate side-by-side comparison of results from different runs. 

The two csv files used in demo:

* BAU: BAUB-ssy copy.csv
* DEV: BAUB-AG1P-devc copy.csv
