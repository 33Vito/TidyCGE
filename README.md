Back up of TidyCGE shinyapp

This shinyapp explores the csv results from [GEMPACK](https://www.copsmodels.com/gempack.htm) (General Equilibrium Modelling PACKage), which is is a suite of economic modelling software. It is especially suitable for computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, but can handle a wide range of economic behaviour.
